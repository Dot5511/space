 # Weapons and alert levels

  ## Foreword
  While firearms of all varieties are incredibly common across known-space, the NanoTrasen Corporation does not permit
  individuals without proper licenses to carry weapons onboard its stations. [color=#a40000]Carrying any weapon on NanoTrasen property
  without proper authorization is a crime.[/color]

  ## Armament escalation
  Code Green: Security and Command are only permitted to visibly carry small firearms like pistols, lethal rounds permitted. (CCO may carry a chester if loaded with non-lethal rounds)
  The default code when no threats are present. Code greens are usually calm and easy shifts.

  Code Blue: Security and Command are permitted to carry longer arms and rifles including lethal ammunitions at the discretion of the HOS and warden. Avoid excessive arming.
  The code when there are signs of hostile activity, whether it is from alien lifeforms or syndicate traitors within the crew. It can get chaotic and it could get out of hand.

  Code Red: Security and Commmand are expected to carry heavy weaponry to keep the crew safe. On code red the crew (only crew, not non-crew) may be armed at the discretion of command.
  The code when the station is facing extreme danger or has a real shortage of command and security, the crew is suggested to move together and request arms from security if they think it is necessary.

  Salvagers are allowed to carry special salvager weapons which aren't traditional firearms but special weaponry made for just salvage specialists.
